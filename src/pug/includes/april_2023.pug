- var about = "A Code Sprint is a three day virtual event, where dozens of developers from around the world come together to code and share their ideas. The main goals of this code sprint are to support the development of open standards for geospatial information and to support the development of free and open source software which implements those standards, as well as creating awareness about the standards and software projects. This code sprint takes place on camptocamp's offices (near Lausanne, Switzerland) and at the OGC-events Discord server. It is organised by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Open Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) and the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and it is hosted by camptocamp.";
